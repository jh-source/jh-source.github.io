Hi, everyone. Welcome to my homepage.

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.virginia.edu/">University of Virginia (UVA)</a>, advised by Professor <a href="https://nandofioretto.github.io/">Ferdinando Fioretto</a>. Before that, I completed my M.Phil degree in Computer and Information Engineering at <a href="https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en">The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK Shenzhen)</a>, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.wuchenye.cn">Chenye Wu</a>. I also obtained a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at <a href="https://en.xidian.edu.cn/">Xidian University (XDU)</a>.



<header><h2>Research</h2></header>

I am particularly interested in integrating generative AI with optimization to address complex scientific and engineering challenges. Currently, my research topics focus on developing algorithms to ensure the output of diffusion models satisfying constraints with provably guarantees by introducing differentiable optimization techniques into diffusion process. Specifically, I aim to tackle challenges in critical domains such as power systems and robotics, contributing to scalable and adaptive solutions for real-world applications.
